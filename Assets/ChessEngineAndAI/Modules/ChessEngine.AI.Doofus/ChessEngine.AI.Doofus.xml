            Doofus chess AI.
            
            Doofus is not very bright, he will always make a tit-for-tat trade, he will never pass up an opportunity to take a piece, and he rarely makes the best possible move.
            Doofus does not hesitate and always moves quickly.

            <summary>
            Invoked after every 'Update' call.
            Useful for executing any logic every frame.
            Recommended AI best move determination logic is here, you can use 'IsBestMovePending' to check if there is a best move to limit planning time only to during best move requests.

        <member name="M:ChessEngine.AI.Doofus.DoofusChessAI.OnBestMoveRequestUpdate">
            <summary>
            Invoked after every 'OnUpdate' in any frame where 'IsBestMovePending == true' and 'IsBestMoveDelayed == false'.
            Logic to determine best moves should not be executed in this loop as a submission delay causes it to not be executed.
            It is best practice to submit ready best moves in this callback unless they were demanded, this will prevent any non-demanded submissions while there is a best move submission delay set.
