            Guy chess AI.
            
            Guy is a well balanced chess AI that takes as much time as he is allowed to carefully consider each move and it's consequences further in the game.
            Guys difficulty scales with allowed think time and allowed think depth.
            Guy may think on only a single thread at a time.

            Logic to determine best moves should not be executed in this loop as a submission delay causes it to not be executed.
            It is best practice to submit ready best moves in this callback unless they were demanded, this will prevent any non-demanded submissions while there is a best move submission delay set.
